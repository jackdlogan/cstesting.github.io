						most of the fundamental topics in computer science. Our program
						focus on achieving two main goals, 1- preparing students to be competitive
						on the job market in computer science at the end of their undergraduate
						studies; 2- preparing students to pursue their formation at graduate level in
						different specialized topics directly related to computer science or related
						to information technologies in other fields of activities such as business,
						medicine, engineering, law, etc. In order to achieve these two goals, we
						seek to develop two main trusts of abilities: 1- become excellent applied
						computer scientists by developing programming skills in some core programming
						languages and obtaining a deep understanding of core topics
						in computer science such as software engineering, databases, computer
						architecture and computer networks; 2- develop student’s analytical skills
						through several courses in mathematics and also in foundational analytical
						topics of computer science such as algorithmic and mathematical models
						of computer computation.</p>

						<b style="color: #911e1e">THE TEACHING STAFF</b><br>
						Courses will be taught by professors coming from the University of Applied
						Sciences in Frankfurt/Main, Cologne University of Applied Sciences,
						and the Bonn-Rhine-Sieg University of Applied Sciences in Germany and
						by full time professors working at VGU. Professors in our program have
						received their PhD degree from top universities in Europe, North America
						and Asia. Students have also at their disposition VGU’s Vietnamese tutors
						which assist for exercises and laboratories as well as helping to answer
						student’s questions about lectures and examinations.<br>
						<b style="color: #911e1e">THE BACHELOR PROGRAM</b><br>
						Our bachelor program in Computer Science is the same as the Computer
						Science program at Frankfurt University of Applied Sciences. This means
						the courses are the same, but also the teaching method and philosophy are
						the same, the way the class are conducted and our examination rules are
						the same and the degree granted is the Bachelor Degree in Computer Science
						from the Frankfurt University of Applied Sciences. One particularity
						of the teaching method and philosophy in applied sciences universities in
						Germany is the emphasis on practical training, where students spend a lot
						of time in laboratories doing practical exercises, and in the case of computer
						science students, spending a lot time coding in different programming
						languages and for different applications. Students don’t spend all
						their time reading books, their learning is grounded in direct experiences
						with the tools and problems computer scientists use and solve.<br>
						<b style="color: #911e1e">1st and 2nd Semester:</b><br>
						The first two semesters focus on mathematical foundations such as calculus
						and algebra, as well as mathematics more directly related to computer
						science such as discrete mathematics, algorithms and data structures and
						models of computation. These two semesters also provide an opening to
						the field of computer science. In the first semester they get a general introduction
						to all aspects of computers, at hardware and software levels.
						They also start there training in programming languages, they get in depth
						courses in two programming languages C and C++. Finally students study
						the functioning of computers at the physical level through the course computer
						architectures.<br>
						<b style="color: #911e1e">3rd and 4th Semester:</b><br>
						These two semesters will lead the students into a variety of computer science
						topics. Software engineering analysis and design principles will be
						taught with a lot of programming exercises. The technical backgrounds
						and applications of databases and in particular networks will be examined
						with in-depth lab exercises using contemporary hardware compo-
						nents. General operating systems, as well as real-time systems running
						on embedded systems are introduced with hands-on studies. Considering
						a world of networks, we additionally focus on distributed systems and
						do not forget about IT Security. Finally students get two more programming
						courses, one in Java, and one in the language of their choice through
						programming exercises. Through ongoing project works, students will acquire
						skills in teamwork, negotiations, presentations and are prepared for
						a dynamic working environment.<br>
						<b style="color: #911e1e">5th Semester:</b><br>
						Being equipped with the knowledge gathered in the first four semesters,
						here the students are provided some freedom to realize IT projects in laboratories
						in order to be able to apply the learned approaches systematically.
						In order to substantiate the scientific education, through projects, we discuss
						contemporary subjects of computer science and in addition enhance
						the knowledge of IT Security with the required legal issues. Additional
						room is left for interdisciplinary issues ’Studium Generale’.<br>
						<b style="color: #911e1e">6th Semester:</b><br>
						This semester is packed with projects, internship in companies and the
						bachelor’s thesis. The students will have to apply their hardware and software
						skills in a blended way to solve practical problems and in real-world
						situations. In the thesis, students are expected to demonstrate suficient
						proficiency in technical and interdisciplinary topics to work as an engineer.
						The following table of modules gives a general overview of the modules
						offered in this program. Many of these modules will be taught as block
						seminars of two to four weeks in duration.
